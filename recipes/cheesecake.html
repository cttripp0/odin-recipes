        Cheesecake is a rich, creamy dessert made from a smooth blend of cream cheese, sugar, and eggs atop a buttery
        graham
        cracker crust. Baked low and slow, it develops a dense yet silky texture that melts in your mouth. The base
        crust—made from crushed graham crackers, sugar, and melted butter—is pressed into a springform pan and briefly
        baked
        to provide a sturdy, golden foundation. The filling typically includes cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and eggs,
        with
        optional ingredients like sour cream or lemon juice to enhance the flavor and texture. Once baked, it’s cooled
        slowly to prevent cracking, then chilled to fully set.

        A classic cheesecake is incredibly versatile—it can be served plain or dressed up with toppings like fresh
        berries,
        fruit compote, or a drizzle of chocolate or caramel. Some bakers use a water bath during baking to maintain a
        smooth, crack-free surface, while others prefer a rustic finish. Whether enjoyed as a special occasion dessert
        or a
        decadent treat on a regular day, cheesecake is beloved for its balance of tangy richness and sweet simplicity.
        Variations like New York-style, chocolate swirl, or no-bake versions offer endless possibilities for personal
        flair.

        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Preheat the oven:</h3>
            <ol>
                Set your oven to 325°F (160°C). If using a springform pan, wrap the bottom and sides with aluminum foil to
                prevent leaks during the water bath (optional but helps even baking).
            </ol>
            <h3>Make the crust:</h3>
            <ol>
                Mix graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter until combined. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom
                of
                a 9-inch springform pan to form an even crust. Bake for 10 minutes, then let cool while preparing the
                filling.
            </ol>
            <h3>Prepare the filling:</h3>
            <ol>
                In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Add sugar and mix until fully
                incorporated. Beat in vanilla, then the eggs one at a time. Stir in sour cream, flour (if using), and lemon
                juice.
            </ol>
            <h3>Assemble and bake:</h3>
            <ol>
                Pour the filling over the cooled crust. For best results, place the pan in a larger baking dish filled with
                1–2
                inches of hot water (water bath). Bake for 55–70 minutes, or until the center is just slightly jiggly but
                set
                around the edges.
            </ol>
            <h3>Cool gradually:</h3>
            <ol>
                Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside with the door slightly open for about 1 hour. Remove
                from
                the oven, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
            </ol>
            <h3>Serve:</h3>
            <ol>
                Carefully remove the cheesecake from the pan. Top with fruit, sauce, or leave plain for a classic look.
                Slice
                with a knife dipped in hot water for clean cuts.
            </ol>
