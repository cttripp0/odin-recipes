        A classic burger is the ultimate handheld meal—simple yet endlessly customizable. At its heart, it’s a seasoned
        beef
        patty, seared to juicy perfection, and nestled between two soft, toasted buns. The contrast between the crisp
        crust
        of the grilled meat and the pillowy texture of the bun is irresistible, and the flavor deepens with every
        topping—whether it’s melted cheese, tangy pickles, fresh lettuce, or a dollop of your favorite sauce.

        Burgers can range from backyard basics to gourmet creations. Some opt for American cheese and ketchup; others
        elevate theirs with caramelized onions, fried eggs, or aioli. No matter how it’s built, the burger is a
        universally
        loved comfort food because of its satisfying bite, rich flavors, and the freedom to tailor every layer to
        personal
        taste. Whether grilled over flames or cooked on a stovetop, a good burger hits all the right notes.

        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Form the patties:</h3>
            <li>
                In a bowl, gently mix ground beef with salt, pepper, and optional seasonings. Divide into 4 equal portions and
                shape into patties about ¾-inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to
                help it cook evenly.
            </li>
            <h3>Cook the patties:</h3>
            <li>
                Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the patties for 3–4 minutes per side for medium, flipping
                once. Add cheese during the last minute of cooking and cover to melt.
            </li>
            <h3>Toast the buns:</h3>
            <li>
                While the patties cook, lightly butter the insides of the buns and toast them in a pan or on the grill until
                golden brown.
            </li>
            <h3>Assemble the burgers:</h3>
            <li>
                Place each cooked patty on a bottom bun. Top with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, and your choice of sauce.
                Add the top bun, press lightly, and serve immediately.
            </li>
