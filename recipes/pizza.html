        Cheese pizza is a timeless favorite that captures the essence of what makes pizza so beloved: a crisp, chewy
        crust,
        a tangy tomato sauce, and a blanket of melted, gooey cheese. It’s simple, yet deeply satisfying. Whether cooked
        in a
        wood-fired oven, on a pizza stone, or in a home oven, the balance between the crisp bottom and the bubbling
        cheese
        on top makes every bite a warm, savory delight. The mozzarella stretches with each pull, and the lightly charred
        edges of the crust add just the right amount of texture.

        Though it may seem basic, cheese pizza is far from boring. It serves as the perfect canvas—delicious on its own
        or
        ready to be dressed up with endless toppings. The quality of ingredients matters: a well-made dough, rich and
        slightly sweet tomato sauce, and a generous layer of real mozzarella elevate it from fast food to an artisan
        treat.
        Whether you’re feeding a crowd or enjoying a personal pie, cheese pizza offers comfort, flavor, and nostalgia
        all in
        one slice.

    <h2> Ingredients (Makes 1 medium pizza, 8 slices)
    </h2>
    <h3>For the dough:</h3>
    <li>2¼ tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>¾ cup warm water (about 110°F/43°C)</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>½ tsp sugar (optional, helps activate yeast)</li>

    <h3>For the sauce and topping:</h3>
    <li>½ cup pizza or marinara sauce</li>
    <li>1½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese (whole milk mozzarella preferred)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil (for brushing crust)</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried oregano or basil (optional)</li>
    <li>Flour or cornmeal (for dusting the baking surface)</li>
    </ul>


    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>Make the dough (if not using store-bought):</h3>
        <li>
            In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy. In a large bowl,
            combine flour and salt, then add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until it forms a dough, knead for 5–7
            minutes until smooth, then let rise in a greased bowl covered with a towel for 1 hour, or until doubled.
        </li>

        <h3>Preheat and shape:</h3>
        <li>
            Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, preheat it as well. Punch down the dough, then roll
            or stretch it into a 12-inch circle on a floured surface.
        </li>

        <h3>Assemble the pizza:</h3>
        <li>
            Transfer the dough to a baking sheet or pizza peel dusted with cornmeal or flour. Spread a thin layer of tomato
            sauce over the dough, leaving a small border. Sprinkle mozzarella evenly on top, then optionally dust with dried
            herbs.
        </li>

        <h3>Bake:</h3>
        <li>
            Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbling. For extra crispness,
            broil the top for the last 1–2 minutes, watching carefully.
        </li>

        <h3>Finish and serve:</h3>
        <li>
            Brush the crust with olive oil for shine, slice, and serve hot. Enjoy as-is or with chili flakes, garlic oil, or
            fresh basil on top.
        </li>
