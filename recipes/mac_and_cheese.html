    <p>Macaroni and cheese, often simply called mac and cheese, is a classic comfort dish made from tender
        pasta—typically elbow macaroni—coated in a rich, creamy cheese sauce. The foundation of the sauce usually begins
        with a roux of butter and flour, blended with milk to create a smooth béchamel before melting in generous
        amounts of cheddar or a blend of cheeses. The result is a warm, savory dish with a silky texture and a
        satisfying, cheesy flavor that appeals to both kids and adults alike. </p>

    <p>Though traditionally served as a stovetop or baked casserole side dish, mac and cheese has evolved into a
        versatile meal in its own right. Variations abound, with additions like crispy bacon, breadcrumbs, lobster, or
        even truffle oil elevating it from humble comfort food to gourmet indulgence. Whether dressed up or kept simple,
        mac and cheese remains a beloved staple in many households, celebrated for its nostalgic warmth and indulgent
        simplicity.</p>

    <h2> Ingredients (Serves 4–6)
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz (about 2 cups) elbow macaroni</li>

        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>

        <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>2 cups milk (whole milk preferred)</li>

        <li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>

        <li>½ tsp salt (adjust to taste)</li>

        <li>¼ tsp black pepper</li>

        <li>¼ tsp paprika (optional, for color and flavor)</li>

        <li>½ cup breadcrumbs (optional, for baked topping)</li>

        <li>1 tbsp butter (for breadcrumb topping, optional)</li>

    </ul>


    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>Boil the pasta:</strong></h3>
        <li>
            Cook the elbow macaroni in salted boiling water according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and
            set
            aside.
        </li>

        <h3>Make the roux:</strong></h3>
        <li>
            In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Stir in the flour and cook for 1–2
            minutes,
            whisking constantly, until it forms a paste and smells slightly nutty (but not browned).
        </li>

        <h3>Add the milk:</strong></h3>
        <li>
            Slowly whisk in the milk, making sure there are no lumps. Cook for 3–5 minutes, stirring constantly, until
            the
            sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
        </li>

        <h3>Add the cheese and seasonings:</strong></h3>
        <li>
            Remove the pan from heat. Stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, and paprika (if using) until
            smooth
            and melted.
        </li>

        <h3>Combine with pasta:</strong></h3>
        <li>Add the drained macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir until fully coated.</li>

        <h3>(Optional) Bake it:</strong></h3>
        <li>
            For a crispy top, pour the mac and cheese into a greased baking dish. In a small bowl, mix the breadcrumbs
            with
            1 tablespoon of melted butter, then sprinkle on top. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 15–20 minutes, or until
            golden
            and bubbling.
        </li>
    </ol>
