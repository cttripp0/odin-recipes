    <p>Macaroni and cheese, often simply called mac and cheese, is a classic comfort dish made from tender
        pasta—typically elbow macaroni—coated in a rich, creamy cheese sauce. The foundation of the sauce usually begins
        with a roux of butter and flour, blended with milk to create a smooth béchamel before melting in generous
        amounts of cheddar or a blend of cheeses. The result is a warm, savory dish with a silky texture and a
        satisfying, cheesy flavor that appeals to both kids and adults alike. </p>

    <p>Though traditionally served as a stovetop or baked casserole side dish, mac and cheese has evolved into a
        versatile meal in its own right. Variations abound, with additions like crispy bacon, breadcrumbs, lobster, or
        even truffle oil elevating it from humble comfort food to gourmet indulgence. Whether dressed up or kept simple,
        mac and cheese remains a beloved staple in many households, celebrated for its nostalgic warmth and indulgent
        simplicity.</p>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>Cook the pasta:</h3>
        <li>Boil macaroni in salted water until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>

        <h3>Cook the mushrooms:</h3>
        <li>
            In a skillet, heat olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add mushrooms and sauté until browned and tender
            (5–7
            minutes). Add garlic near the end if using. Stir in the cooked chicken just to warm through. Set aside.

        <h3>Make the cheese sauce:</h3>
        <li>
            In a saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1–2 minutes to
            form a
            roux. Slowly add the milk, whisking until smooth and thickened (about 3–5 minutes). Remove from heat and
            stir in
            cheese, salt, pepper, and paprika until melted.
        </li>

        <h3>Combine everything:</h3>
        <li>Stir the cooked pasta, chicken, and mushrooms into the cheese sauce. Mix until evenly coated.</li>

        <h3>(Optional) Bake it:</h3>
        <li>
            Pour mixture into a greased baking dish. Toss breadcrumbs with 1 tbsp melted butter and sprinkle on top.
            Bake at
            375°F (190°C) for 15–20 minutes, until golden and bubbling.
